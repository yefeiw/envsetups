# Desktop Management

Desktop management always have a lot of room to be improved on any operating systems.

For mac, i recommend the following tools.
[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/com)

it is an open source tool used to resize windows as you wanted. per [this article](https://www.slant.co/topics/526/~best-window-manager-for-mac), the top con is that it is not configurable. For me that is not a problem though.
